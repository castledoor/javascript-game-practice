<h1> Step - by - Step Checkers </h1>

<p>Alot of new developers go through online tutorials of other learning aids and feel that maybe they have enough knowledge to get started on their own project, and many become quickly discouraged because they feel overwhelmed, dont know where to start or just try to take too many new concepts all at once.</p>

<p>Any time I ever had a complex life problem to solve, my mother would always ask me, "How do you eat an elephant?"  and the answer is, "one bite at a time."</p>

<p>So this tutorial is geared toward that new programmer who just dosnt know where to start, all the individual concepts that go into building a checkers game broken down into super small stand alone parts and slowly build onto each other</p>

<p>1. Getting one Peice to jump around a 9x9 board</p>
<p>2. Writing a function that sets up a 9 x 9 board</p>
